Recently I've learned some music theory and forced myself to transcribe chords for several songs. To ensure accuracy, I repeatedly listened to every detail of a song, which also seemed to train my perception of chord progressions, tonal colors, and motifs.

Today I happened to hear an old favorite song, and unconsciously started analyzing its chords in my mind, feeling like I understood it more deeply. Then I froze in surpriseâ€”this song's chord progression was identical to a classical piece. I began imagining how the composer employed these chords and utilized them to create the song's unique color palette. The interplay between CM7 and Fm7 wove a tranquil atmosphere. It might be coincidence, or perhaps a common compositional technique.

I sensed a vague yet profound resonance. I feel compelled to revisit many songs I once loved. I might discover flaws in some, or develop deeper appreciation for others. Regardless, it seems worthwhile to take out those old favorites and give them another listen.
